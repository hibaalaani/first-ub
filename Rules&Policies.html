            <ul>
                <li>The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire
                    youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player,
                    coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior
                    detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of

                <li><h2>DIMENSIONS. </h2>
                <p>FIFA Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions
                    within a given maximum and minimum width and length. These
                    dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12
                    and older.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h2>COMPETITION FIELDS.</h2>
                <p>Fields used within the competition program must
                    be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards. Leagues, districts or associations
                    participating in the state competition program that are unable to provide a
                    field that meets these minimum requirements must advise the State
                    Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the
                    field and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum
                    dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or
                    associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be
                    required to play all their games away</p></li>
                <li><h2>FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS.</h2>
                <ol class="itali">
                    <li><p>U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty
                        areas. Fields for older age groups should be progressively larger. </p></li>
                    <li><p>U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards width.</p></li>
                    <li><p>U-10 play on a field 70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards in width.</p></li>
                    <li><p>In addition, fields used by young age groups may have their internal
                        dimensions and size of goal similarly modified.</p></li>

                           <ul><li> <p>The decision for team/spectator placement on the field will
                            be made by the governing body of that team. A team’s
                            bench area shall consist of that area at least one (1) yard

                            both ways from the halfway line. In the event that field

                            to remain within their bench area during the game. Parents
                            and spectators should occupy the same side of the field as
                            the team they are supporting.</p></li></ul>

                    indicated below. A player who has been replaced may re-enter the game

                <h2>CONFISCATED PLAYER PASSES</h2>
                <p>Passes of any individual(s) ejected from any match shall be retained after
                    the match by the referee. The pass of any individual who has received a
                    third caution (yellow card) during a playing year shall be confiscated by
                    the referee at the conclusion of the match in which the third caution was
                    received. That player will be suspended from playing in the next game in
                    which the offending participant would otherwise be eligible to participate.
                    This process will continue so that for every third yellow card received
                    during a playing year, the player will be suspended from playing in the
                    next game (after the receipt of a third yellow card) for which the offending
                    participate would otherwise be eligible to participate. The referee shall
                    deliver all confiscated passes to the UYSA State Office within forty-eight
                    (48) hours of the conclusion of the match.</p>
              
                    <h2>ALL-PLAY</h2>
        <p>All-play means that every recreation player on every team shall play at
            least fifty percent of each game. Coaches in the competition program are
            encouraged to play their players 50% of each game.
            o A Coach shall be permitted to not play a player 50% of each game
            under special circumstances, e.g., unexcused absences from
            practice and/or games, ungentlemanly conduct at practice and/or
            games, and injuries.</p>
            <h2>PLAYERS’ EQUIPMENT
            </h2>
            <p>Where the uniform colors of both teams are so similar that the referee
                orders a change, the designated home team must change to colors
                distinct from those of the opponent.</p>
